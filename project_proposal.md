## Background and Motivation

In the current political climate, it is impossible to ignore the flood of information that is given by social media and politicians. As a result, it is important to be able to critically think about the claims that are made on the current state of government, economy, and our society. We aim to focus on three main topics: the claim that migrant crime is on the rise, the claim that the economy suffered greatly during the Biden administration, and the claim that the presidential election was stolen from the Republican party in 2020. Through examining these claims, we aim to provide an overview on different topics that have been main, recent talking points in the media and by politicians from a data-driven, evidence-based perspective.

## Project Objectives

The primary questions we are trying to answer with our visualization are tangential to the three topics of focus listed in the previous section: is the claim that migrant crime is on the rise accurate, is the claim that the economy suffered greatly during the Biden administration factual, and is the claim that the presidential election was stolen from the Republican party grounded in truth. However, our goal for this project is verify claims made by politicians and in the media through data-driven and statistical methods. Rather than appealing to pathos, we aim to ground our claims with the data that is collected and the analyses conducted.

## Data

The data that we are going to use will be 

## Data Processing

In terms of data processing, we expect that there will be some data cleaning involved given the amount of datasets that we will be using. In order to preform the data cleaning tasks, we will be using R or Python. Some of the derived

## Visualization Design

## Must-Have Features

For must-have features, we want to be able to include a thorough analysis of each of our claims, which would entail utilizing a variety of visualizations culminating to tell one story. In particular, we anticipate using many graphs such as line and bar graphs to show percent change over time. Our main focus is to have as many of these individual graphs as are necessary to support our analysis of each claim we plan to cover. In addition, we also want the visualization to tell a story through scrollytelling. This is an important part of our visualization as it will allow us to present our evidence in a logical order and ensure that the viewer is engaged with our content. We also need to have an introduction to the project overall, as well as a brief introduction/context for each topic. Finally, we feel it is a requirement to have at least 2 of the 3 topics we have chosen, and the third will be a stretch goal, which we will determine the feasability of as the project progresses. 

## Optional Features

Many of our optional features focus on aesthetics, as we feel the argument is the most crucial part to include, followed by the presentation which can support the argument and engage the viewer. We hope to be able to include a choropleth of the United States and allow the viewer to click on each state to view different statistics (for the claim about migrant crimes). Our first priority is to include data for the United States as a whole, and then if we are able to include data from each individual state to allow some interactivity. For more interactivity, we hope to include features which allow the user to click on/hover over bar graphs to display the specific number. This could also be a useful accessibility tool, so we hope to include it. Lastly, we hope to add some animations to the static visuals as the user scrolls. These will be in addition to the scrollytelling, and will make the site more engaging and visually appealing.
