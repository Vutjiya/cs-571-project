## Background and Motivation

In the current political climate, it is impossible to ignore the flood of information that is given by social media and politicians. As a result, it is important to be able to critically think about the claims that are made on the current state of government, economy, and our society. We aim to focus on three main topics: the claim that migrant crime is on the rise, the claim that the economy suffered greatly during the Biden administration, and the claim that the presidential election was stolen from the Republican party in 2020. Through examining these claims, we aim to provide an overview on different topics that have been main, recent talking points in the media and by politicians from a data-driven, evidence-based perspective.

## Project Objectives

The primary questions we are trying to answer with our visualization are tangential to the three topics of focus listed in the previous section: is the claim that migrant crime is on the rise accurate, is the claim that the economy suffered greatly during the Biden administration factual, and is the claim that the presidential election was stolen from the Republican party grounded in truth. However, our goal for this project is verify claims made by politicians and in the media through data-driven and statistical methods. Rather than appealing to pathos, we aim to ground our claims with the data that is collected and the analyses conducted.
