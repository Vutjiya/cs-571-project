                    Distinguishing Fact and Fiction in Modern U.S. Politics
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the current political climate, it is impossible to ignore the flood of information that is given by social media and politicians. 
                    As a result, it is important to be able to critically think about the claims that are made on the current state of government, economy, and our society. 
                    We aim to focus on three main topics: the claim that migrant crime is on the rise, the claim that the economy suffered greatly during the Biden administration, and the claim that banning TikTok will protect the U.S.'s security and interests. 
                    Through examining these claims, we aim to provide an overview on these different topics that have been main, recent talking points in the media and by politicians from a data-driven, evidence-based perspective. 
                    By doing so, we want to be able to determine whether these sweeping, overarching assertions hold any weight, or if they are just propaganda.

                    Migrant Crime
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The first claim we aim to address with this project is the issue of "migrant crime". Donald Trump claims that so-called migrant crime, which is any crime committed by immigrants, will be "worse than any other type of crime." But what does this mean, and is his claim that this new category of crime is worse than all other crime actually sound? That is what we hope to answer by looking at data from a variety of sources like the FBI Crime Data and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Criminal Alien Statistics.

                    Biden's Economy
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The next claim we will look into is the claim that Joe Biden's economy was signficantly worse. This topic is of major interest as one of Trump's main talking points, and what many voters put great importance on, was the idea that the economy under Biden had failed so signficantly that Trump needed to clean it up. 
                    For this claim, we will look at severals areas of the economy, including the unemployment rate (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and average disposable personal income (Bureau of Economic Analysis).

                    The third claim we may address is that the 2020 presidential election was skewed by false vote counts and was effectively stolen. This is a stretch goal, so we haven't included it on the site page yet.
