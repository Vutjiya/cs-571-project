                    In the current political climate, it is impossible to ignore the flood of information from social media and politicians. As a result, it is important to be able to critically think about the claims that are made on the current state of government, economy, and our society. We aim to focus on a few topics, where we provide statistical arguments as to why some of these were baseless or wrong.

                        Trump coined the term "migrant crime", which means the crime commited (proven or alleged) by a foreign national, i.e. a migrant. Fox news has also had a big idea in spreading this propoganda to try and prove this by selectively handpicking data points and biasing news. Quoting one of Trump's statements,
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>“Our cities are being overrun with migrant crime, and that's Biden migrant crime. But it's a new category of crime and it's violent.”</i>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But how true are these claims? We investigate this by providing data from articles published by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Federal Bureau of Investigation on surveys on prison inmates, criminal alien statistics and a crime data explorer, respectively.

                        Trump has frequently mentioned that the economy inherited from Biden was terrible, and "went to hell". He aso mentioned that job growth was horrible, there was high inflation. Quoting one of Trump's statements, 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>“We inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.”</i>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But how true are these claims? We investigate these using data on inflation rates, unemployment rates and GDP.
